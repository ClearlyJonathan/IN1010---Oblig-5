# IN1010 - Innlevering 5: Dominante MÃ¸nstre

This repository contains my solution for **Innlevering 5** in the course [IN1010: Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN1010/) at the University of Oslo. The assignment focuses on analyzing dominant patterns in genetic sequences using object-oriented principles in Java.

## Assignment Overview

The goal of this assignment is to develop a program that identifies dominant patterns in genetic sequences. The implementation emphasizes the use of **inheritance**, **interfaces**, and **interaction between classes** to create a well-structured application.

## Concepts Covered

- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Creating a class hierarchy for sequence analysis.
- **Interfaces:** Defining common behaviors for different analysis strategies.
- **Data Structures:** Utilizing appropriate data structures to manage and analyze genetic sequences.
- **File I/O:** Reading from and writing to files to manage input and output data.
- **Exception Handling:** Managing errors and exceptions gracefully.
- **Threads**

*This project was developed as part of the coursework for IN1010 at the University of Oslo.*
